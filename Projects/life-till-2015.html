<em>Adobe Flash Pro CS3, ActionScript 2.0</em>

</br>
<br>

Created a complete, interactive and animated magazine “Abhyuday” using Adobe Flash CS3 (AS 2.0) for our university. I had worked on this project as a single developer. I created a robust and different GUI for each of the articles in the magazine. Each article had to be interacted in a different way, so that the user can read the whole article. For the magazine, I have mostly used the stock art and manipulated it in Photoshop as per the GUI. So, not all the art which you will see in the magazine, belongs to me. But the development and making things work was completely my responsibility. The links for the photo galleries are not working because I removed the related folders.

</br>
<br>

So, to interact with the magazine please follow this <a target="_blank" href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B4F3bMLTr22dTE5FZURXR2tkV00">link</a> to open in new tab. It is about 61 MB, so it might take time to load the page.
