    [Initially started in Unity3D with Oculus SDK, later shifted to Unreal Engine 4.x with Tobii EyeX SDK]
    <br><br>
    "The Channeler" is a research capstone project/game. This game was made in two phases. The game initially was proposed for having eye tracking with VR headset. 
    <br>
    But due to the cost concerns, we decided to have only head tracking through VR headset. We started developing the game with Oculus Rift VR headset, using Unity3D. The center of the screen on Oculus Display was to be considered as the gaze of the player.
    <br><br>
    Later on, we increased the scope by shifting the game to "Unreal Engine 4.x" and instead of having the 'head tracking only', we started with both eye-tracking and head tracking as a desktop-only game instead of VR. This was achieved using the "Tobii EyeX Controller Device".
    <br><br>
    My role was UI and gameplay programmer. Duties involved developing and mapping the UI and mechanics using the eye-gaze detected by the device.

    The 3D object which can be interacted with the Gaze of player are called as "EyeX Base Actors". This has an Eye-Gaze event, which gets triggered when the player looks at that object.
    <br><br>
    This object was inherited in many ways by us programmers. I made a component to be attached to this actor, which communicates with the HUD.
    <br><br>
    In the video, the transparent circle moving around is an aid about where the player is currently looking at.
    <br><br>
    @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7vkOs1Z1AE#">00:00</a> The first component was opacity of the eye. When the player starts looking at any EyeX Actor having this component will increase the opacity and vice versa when the player is looking away.
    <br><br>
    @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7vkOs1Z1AE#">00:07</a> The second component was Timer. Some EyeX objects were needed to be triggered after some delay. So until the delay, the timer will keep filling.
    <br><br>
    I also worked on the HUD, using both C++, for the good amount of math and Blueprints for the material selection and exposing some nodes for producers, to customize the UI. This was an amazing experience as I got to work on Materials too. This circular menu has some proxy art when this video was recorded.
    <br><br>
    @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7vkOs1Z1AE#">00:14</a> This GUI was highly customizable by producers, the scale of icons, opacity of each material, scale of the circular divisions, etc. The way it works is, on pressing a key the menu will popup and the user has to look at the option to select it. The last selected option will be whitish and the one currently under gaze of the player is Orange.
    <br><br>
    Apart from the HUD, I also worked on the UMG for the menu transitions like New Game, Pause Menu, Level Selection, etc.
